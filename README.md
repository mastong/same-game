# Same game

Not sure about the game name, that's the name our teacher used back in the days when I first make this application (in Java at the time)...  

# Game principle
The objective is to empty the board.  
To do so, the user click on the piece, and if there's at least 2 piece of the same color side by side, the pieces are removed, and the board is "squeeze".  

The squeeze rules are simple : 
- if there's an empty cell below a piece, the piece go down from one cell  
- if there's an empty column the others column at its right side are moved one column to the left
